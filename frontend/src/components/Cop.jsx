        <h3>About COP</h3>
        <p>
          The Citizens On Patrol (COP) scheme was started in 1999 and has grown
          to be a sizable force. It was launched to enable patrols by the
          community to alert the Police when they observe suspicious activities
          or persons and engage the community on crime prevention measures.

          per month. They patrol the neighbourhood, disseminate crime prevention
          advisories and report to the Police on suspicious persons or crime in
          progress.
        </p>
